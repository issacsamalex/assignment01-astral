## Implementation Overview

#### Key Implementation Details

- #### Dynamic Add/Edit Page:
    - The application uses a single page for both adding and editing products (routes/products/$id.tsx).
    - If the id parameter is "new", a new product is created; otherwise, the product with the given ID is edited.
- #### Database:
    - PostgreSQL is used as the database, and Prisma ORM handles schema definition and database interactions.
    - Products are stored in a Product table with the following fields:
        - id: Primary key (integer).
        - title: Product name (string).
        - quantity: Quantity of the product (integer).
- #### User Interface:
    - The UI is built using Shopify Polaris for a consistent design.
    - Key Polaris components include Page, Card, Button, and TextField.
- #### Double-Click to Edit:
    - Users can double-click the product title to enable an inline editing mode.
